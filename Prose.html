            <h3>Fig Tree Analogy</h3>
            <p>“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”</p>

        <h3 align="right">Excerpt from "The Stranger"</h3>
        <p align="right">"Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I'd lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from somewhere deep in my future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than the ones I was living. What did other people's deaths or a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the lives people choose or the fate they think they elect matter to me when we're all elected by the same fate, me and billions of privileged people like him who also called themselves my brothers? Couldn't he see, couldn't he see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only privileged people. The others would all be condemned one day. And he would be condemned, too."</p>

        <p>Why is it your school? Why am i always in the wrong? Why do i have to listen to you when you have zero to say? Because I’m young? All my life i’ve been young. So i never get a turn. This school is lost. If you asked me, you’re lost. Everybody talks to me like I’m the one, you know, i should change. Why should i change? I’ve never got to find out who i am, you want me to change? It’s crazy! You tell me I’m bad before I even get to be anything. What the hell is that?! Original sin or something? I read Plato I read him on a park bench in the Bronx. But let me tell you something. Plato wasn’t afraid, Diogenes wasn’t afraid, Socrates wasn’t afraid of anything. They were Men. Why are you the headmaster and I’m the student? Didn’t you understand? I have to earn your respect but you don’t have to earn mine. What is that? It’s you want for A before we even start but when i say I want the same thing, I’m not right?! I’m not gonna cry. I’m gonna find my place in this world, you count on that. This school has been a miracle for me but NOT BECAUSE OF YOU. Because somebody Mr Hoffman finally saw me! And more than that, somebody a grown person decided I was good before I was good-...</p>

        <h3 align="right">"Why I'm Quitting Tobacco"</h3>
        <p align="right">
            Recently my advertising agency ended a long relationship with Lucky Strike cigarettes, and I’m relieved.
            <br>
            For over 25 years we devoted ourselves to peddling a product for which good work is irrelevant, because people can’t stop themselves from buying it. A product that never improves, that causes illness, and makes people unhappy. But there was money in it. A lot of money. In fact, our entire business depended on it. We knew it wasn’t good for us, but we couldn’t stop.
            <br>
            And then, when Lucky Strike moved their business elsewhere, I realized, here was my chance to be someone who could sleep at night, because I know what I’m selling doesn’t kill my customers.
            <br>
            So as of today, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce will no longer take tobacco accounts. We know it’s going to be hard. If you’re interested in cigarette work, here’s a list of agencies that do it well: BBDO, Leo Burnett, McCann Erickson, Cutler Gleason & Chaough, and Benton & Bowles.
            <br>
            As for us, we welcome all other business because we’re certain that our best work is still ahead of us.

        <h3>Gloria's Monologue from Barbie (2023)</h3>
        <p>It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.
            <br><br>
            You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people.
            <br><br>
            You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood.
            <br><br>
            But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful.
            <br><br>
            You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.
            <br><br>
            I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.</p>
