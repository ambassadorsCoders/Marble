                - I just watched, <i>In The Mood For Love,</i> last night. It's bittersweet. I delt with heartbreak and being in love with the film in the most intense but simple way, I love it.
                I'm still blown by the chemistry and acting of Maggie Cheung & Tony Leung, it's damn good. A solid 11/10 in my heart (I literally can't make myself watch a new film). I don't need to mention more about the style of the film, gosh, dear, it's a Kong War Kai film, superb. I'm really liking Chinese films these days.

                -... I finally watched one of the movies in my 2025 movie watchlist, it's 17 in total.
                <i>Everything Everywhere All At Once,</i> is a solid 9.7/10, the plot, the sequence, cinematography, acting, and most especially, the message. It's great, it's extraordinary, I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but this one just hits the right spot; the script was excellent, from Joy's monologue, Evelyn's confrontation, to Waymond's:

            - ... I kinda LOVED my fit, yesterday.
            <br> Especially the blue stockings; I found my inspiration from The Love Witch-- Elaine <3
            <br> Anyways, the chat with Angic, last night, was a blast that I realised something,
            <br> I will never be as young as this.

            - It's 9 at night, as I was lying in the dark, on the comforts of my bed and the rain, thinking and worrying, I knew I'm missing out,

            <br> I can't. Today is yesterday's fear, tomorrow is indifferent. I still don't deserve the recognition that I'll receive; they're clueless about it, though I find it hard to restrain myself from yapping about it; I hope to provoke some kind of reaction from them during the ceremony;
            <br> a reaction that might wash my guilt and in denial. Somebody deserves this more than me.
            <br> More than me...
            <br> More than me?
