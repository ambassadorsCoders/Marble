        <h3>Eldorado</h3>
        <pre>
            Gaily bedight,
           A gallant knight,
              In sunshine and in shadow,   
            Had journeyed long,   
            Singing a song,
         In search of Eldorado.
         
            But he grew old—
            This knight so bold—   
         And o’er his heart a shadow—   
            Fell as he found
            No spot of ground
         That looked like Eldorado.
         
            And, as his strength   
            Failed him at length,
         He met a pilgrim shadow—   
            ‘Shadow,’ said he,   
            ‘Where can it be—
         This land of Eldorado?’
         
            ‘Over the Mountains
            Of the Moon,
         Down the Valley of the Shadow,   
            Ride, boldly ride,’
            The shade replied,—
         ‘If you seek for Eldorado!’

         <h3 align="right">Lady Lazarus</h3>
         <pre align="right">
            I have done it again.   
            One year in every ten   
            I manage it——

            A sort of walking miracle, my skin   
            Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   
            My right foot

            A paperweight,
            My face a featureless, fine   
            Jew linen.

            Peel off the napkin   
            O my enemy.   
            Do I terrify?——

            The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   
            The sour breath
            Will vanish in a day.

            Soon, soon the flesh
            The grave cave ate will be   
            At home on me

            And I a smiling woman.   
            I am only thirty.
            And like the cat I have nine times to die.

            This is Number Three.   
            What a trash
            To annihilate each decade.

            What a million filaments.   
            The peanut-crunching crowd   
            Shoves in to see

            Them unwrap me hand and foot——
            The big strip tease.   
            Gentlemen, ladies

            These are my hands   
            My knees.
            I may be skin and bone,

            Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   
            The first time it happened I was ten.   
            It was an accident.

            The second time I meant
            To last it out and not come back at all.   
            I rocked shut

            As a seashell.
            They had to call and call
            And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.

            Dying
            Is an art, like everything else.   
            I do it exceptionally well.

            I do it so it feels like hell.   
            I do it so it feels real.
            I guess you could say I’ve a call.

            It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
            It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.   
            It’s the theatrical

            Comeback in broad day
            To the same place, the same face, the same brute   
            Amused shout:

            ‘A miracle!’
            That knocks me out.   
            There is a charge

            For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   
            For the hearing of my heart——
            It really goes.

            And there is a charge, a very large charge   
            For a word or a touch   
            Or a bit of blood

            Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   
            So, so, Herr Doktor.   
            So, Herr Enemy.

            I am your opus,
            I am your valuable,   
            The pure gold baby

            That melts to a shriek.   
            I turn and burn.
            Do not think I underestimate your great concern.

            Ash, ash—
            You poke and stir.
            Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——

            A cake of soap,   
            A wedding ring,   
            A gold filling.

            Herr God, Herr Lucifer   
            Beware
            Beware.

            Out of the ash
            I rise with my red hair   
            And I eat men like air.
