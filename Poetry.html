        <h3>Eldorado</h3>
        <pre>
            Gaily bedight,
           A gallant knight,
       In sunshine and in shadow,   
            Had journeyed long,   
            Singing a song,
         In search of Eldorado.
         
            But he grew old—
            This knight so bold—   
         And o’er his heart a shadow—   
            Fell as he found
            No spot of ground
         That looked like Eldorado.
         
            And, as his strength   
            Failed him at length,
         He met a pilgrim shadow—   
            ‘Shadow,’ said he,   
            ‘Where can it be—
         This land of Eldorado?’
         
            ‘Over the Mountains
            Of the Moon,
        Down the Valley of the Shadow,   
            Ride, boldly ride,’
            The shade replied,—
         ‘If you seek for Eldorado!’

         <h3 align="right">Lady Lazarus</h3>
         <pre align="right">
            I have done it again.   
            One year in every ten   
            I manage it——

            A sort of walking miracle, my skin   
            Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   
            My right foot

            A paperweight,
            My face a featureless, fine   
            Jew linen.

            Peel off the napkin   
            O my enemy.   
            Do I terrify?——

            The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   
            The sour breath
            Will vanish in a day.

            Soon, soon the flesh
            The grave cave ate will be   
            At home on me

            And I a smiling woman.   
            I am only thirty.
            And like the cat I have nine times to die.

            This is Number Three.   
            What a trash
            To annihilate each decade.

            What a million filaments.   
            The peanut-crunching crowd   
            Shoves in to see

            Them unwrap me hand and foot——
            The big strip tease.   
            Gentlemen, ladies

            These are my hands   
            My knees.
            I may be skin and bone,

            Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   
            The first time it happened I was ten.   
            It was an accident.

            The second time I meant
            To last it out and not come back at all.   
            I rocked shut

            As a seashell.
            They had to call and call
            And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.

            Dying
            Is an art, like everything else.   
            I do it exceptionally well.

            I do it so it feels like hell.   
            I do it so it feels real.
            I guess you could say I’ve a call.

            It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
            It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.   
            It’s the theatrical

            Comeback in broad day
            To the same place, the same face, the same brute   
            Amused shout:

            ‘A miracle!’
            That knocks me out.   
            There is a charge

            For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   
            For the hearing of my heart——
            It really goes.

            And there is a charge, a very large charge   
            For a word or a touch   
            Or a bit of blood

            Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   
            So, so, Herr Doktor.   
            So, Herr Enemy.

            I am your opus,
            I am your valuable,   
            The pure gold baby

            That melts to a shriek.   
            I turn and burn.
            Do not think I underestimate your great concern.

            Ash, ash—
            You poke and stir.
            Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——

            A cake of soap,   
            A wedding ring,   
            A gold filling.

            Herr God, Herr Lucifer   
            Beware
            Beware.

            Out of the ash
            I rise with my red hair   
            And I eat men like air.

            With drive and you can do.
            With ambitions that made you do,
            And you, dote so much, with what to do?

            Now, I ado –
            With things that I can do.
            
            I can’t anew, stiff as a bamboo,
            My fire has been blew,
            I’m left with my blue.
            
            What made you do? What made you do?!?
            
            My mind! It’s unscrewed!
            Things can’t be undo…
            Everything flew,
            Like a dust from a broom,
            Outside it spew,
            
            My fire, will and do.
            To the dead and dark hue.
            
            What made you do? What made you do?...

            I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
            I lift my lids and all is born again.
            (I think I made you up inside my head.)

            The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,
            And arbitrary blackness gallops in:
            I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

            I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
            And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.
            (I think I made you up inside my head.)

            God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:
            Exit seraphim and Satan's men:
            I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

            I fancied you'd return the way you said,
            But I grow old and I forget your name.
            (I think I made you up inside my head.)

            I should have loved a thunderbird instead;
            At least when spring comes they roar back again.
            I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

         <h3>First Date</h3>
         <pre>
            We’d so much in common, that was clear from the start:
            A marriage of souls, like de Beauvoir and Sartre.
            The connection was instant, almost irrational:
            simply simpatico, fully compatible.

            You confessed you loved winter, North Yorkshire, and cats.
            ‘Me, too!’ I responded. ‘How amazing is that?’
            You were wild about Wharton: you loved Ethan Frome.
            ‘His best’, I said, thinking I’d read him when home.

            You praised a revival of Pinter’s Dumb Waiter.
            I nodded along. I should Google that later.
            The discussion then turned to things that you hated:
            Pulp Fiction, you thought, was quite over-rated.

            ‘You make some good points’, I eventually said.
            I could always hide that poster under my bed.
            You spoke of a loathing of poetry that rhymed
            And I said. Yes,
            That stuff’s awful.

            because I didn't understand
            and I didn't understand
            because I wasn't listening
            and I wasn't listening
            because I was staring out of the window
            and I was staring out of the window
            because I saw a cloud.
            I am late, sir,
            because I saw a cloud.

         <h3>A Wondeful Day to Be Dead</h3>
         <pre>
            What a perfect day to be gone and forgotten.
            What a wonderful day to be dead.
            Six feet above me, the world's gone rotten
            while I'm rottin' in a coffin instead.

            You'll die one day and that day could be
            any one of the thousands ahead,
            but I can guarantee that that day will be
            a wonderful say to be dead.

         <pre align="right">
            I made a model out of you;
            Your head and your 
            Squirmy face.

            For years and years, 
            the patience to despise, Never Cease.
            So, I hit the marble like a God,
            With eyes that twinkles with rue for its
            bod permanence and impertinence.

            Stroke the cheeks of bawdry,
            Blow off the dusts of egoism.
            A satisfied vengeance
            To lock away the traces of your
            existence.

            Your ugly face, always leaving a trace.

            The model I made out of you,
            With the same snarl, thorns of brow,
            Trypophobic face, and your prideful gaze.

            The wrinkles of your smile
            Are a map of burned villages,
            Those who forget the trails
            Of it, is a devil like you!

            The marble is light, white,
            But your bust made it quite fright.
